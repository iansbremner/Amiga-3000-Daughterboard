# Amiga-3000-Daughterboard
This is a recreation of the Rev 9 Daughterboard for the Amiga 3000
This is a 4 Layer board with signal on the upper and lower layers and a Power and Ground Plane.

When fabing the board you will probably be asked if you want to remove the solder mask on the area for the Edge Connectors. It is fine to say Yes to this.
